1. When we run the simulation with new.py, the values of nVeh for each link are kind of oscillating.
One iteration it has a lot of vehicles, the next iteration it reduces. and this goes on cyclically. This must be due to sharp change in our parameter values wrt to the error percieved.

2. In v2 i changed p from 0.5 to random.uniform(0,1). Variance reduced a little bit
